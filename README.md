# Home Assistant Config @hassio

Home Assistant is a platform for integrating smart devices and link to HomeKit. Here is my project for creating a smarthome for myself.
Config files are stored here for backups and version control.
Used raspberry pi 3b+ and flashed hassio for it

## Highlights

- Homekit tiles/ blocks like lovelace UI using [ios themes](https://github.com/basnijholt/lovelace-ios-themes)
- Device tracking without tracking gps location and its automation
- Integration of aqara hub and its child devices
